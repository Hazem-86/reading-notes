## I think it’s my inability to use – and stay in – a growth mindset that keeps me from heading home smiling more often. So, I decided to write this to call myself out for moments of fixed-mindedness (and maybe you’ll recognize a bit of yourself in those moments, too), and share my techniques for working through them. If we can get better at catching ourselves in those moments when our brains revert to a fixed mindset, we can pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful.

## The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.
## Believing that your qualities are carved in stone—the fixed mindset—creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over.
## “People in a growth mindset don’t just seek challenge, they thrive on it”.
