# Assignment operators

## An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

## Return value and chaining

### Like most expressions, assignments like x = y have a return value. It can be retrieved by e.g. assigning the expression or logging it:
#### const z = (x = y); // Or equivalently: const z = x = y;

console.log(z); // Log the return value of the assignment x = y.
console.log(x = y); // Or log the return value directly.
